# About

pyCellFoam is a python library that implements the Cell Method  to simulate heat transfer on open cell foams. It was brought to life by the Munich node of the [INFIDHEM project](https://www.mw.tum.de/rt/emc/interconnected-systems-infidhem/) at the TUM Chair of Automatic Control in cooperation with LAGEPP at Universit√© Claude Bernard Lyon 1. An example geometry that can be used in the cell method is shown in Fig. 1.
